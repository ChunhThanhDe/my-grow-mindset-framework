```
If I lose everything I've built
first i will try to contact, seek help to see if i can get it back (CTRL Z xD)

in case i can't get it back, i will upload the source codes i still keep on my computer,
i am quite confident and backup on my computer. at least i will still keep important projects including many branches and private source code

```

### Guidance for Solving

1. **Reassess Your Framework**

Current plans are too close together and if new plans are made, it will be difficult to rearrange the schedule.
need to concentrate and avoid distraction
Always textnote important things and review them at the end of the week.

```

2. **Start Small**

```
Maintaining habits should be a top priority, most failures are due to not having built a habit.
should try to complete the habit for at least 21 consecutive days.
```

3. **Iterate and Improve**
> [!CAUTION]
> Continuously evaluate and adjust your strategies to fit the current context. Use feedback and insights from each step to refine your approach. This iterative process strengthens your framework and prepares it for future challenges.
